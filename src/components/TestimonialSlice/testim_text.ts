			'Two rooms in a new house, kitchen, AC, fridge, wine, cigars - all there and the landlords in another house just 40 yards away. Lovely ladies, and they served great dinn er and a wonderful breakfast. It was a rainy evening and I enjoyed a cigar and a glas of cold wine in my rocking chair on the balcony as well as a thrilling conversation with an ara named Lola on the other side of the street. How was the food? The food was very good, and Marigel is a wonderful cook.How was the room? The room was more than just sufficient, although the steps down to the bathroom next to my bed turned out to become a challenge at night.I made it ;-).',
